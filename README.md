This fork also needs https://github.com/rejeep/f.el and https://github.com/magnars/dash.el installed. You'll need https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper/ installed to use functions that use `counsel`; I plan to eventually make all the functions use that, so install that as well.

To install this package itself, just clone the repository and use `load-file` on `fzf.el`.

# Original Readme

## fzf.el [![MELPA](https://melpa.org/packages/fzf-badge.svg)](https://melpa.org/#/fzf)

An Emacs front-end for [fzf][1].

![demo](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/306502/12380684/ca0a6648-bd46-11e5-9091-841b282874e4.gif)

## installation

fzf.el can be installed through [MELPA][2].

## usage

fzf.el comes with some example commands to try out

- `M-x switch-buffer`
- `M-x fzf-find-file`
- `M-x fzf-find-file-in-dir`
- `M-x fzf-recentf`
- `M-x fzf-grep`

But the real action is writing your own. 

fzf.el exposes three functions:

- `fzf-with-entries (entries action &optional directory)`: run fzf, passing in an elisp list and running the function action with the user's selected results
- `fzf-with-command (command action &optional directory)`: run a shell command and directly pass to fzf. An optimization on top of `fzf-with-entries` so that the output does not have to be stored in emacs before sending to fzf anyway.
- `fzf-base (action &optional directory)`: run fzf with the user's default `FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND`

Using these functions, it's easy to define your own commands that use fzf:

```lisp
(defun fzf-example ()
  (fzf-with-entries
   (list "a" "b" "c")
   'print))
```

Or more exiciting: [fzf-find-file](https://github.com/seenaburns/fzf.el/blob/master/fzf.el#L244)

```lisp
(defun fzf-find-file (&optional directory)
  (interactive)
  (let ((d (fzf/resolve-directory directory)))
    (fzf
    (lambda (x)
        (let ((f (expand-file-name x d)))
        (when (file-exists-p f)
            (find-file f))))
    d)))
```
